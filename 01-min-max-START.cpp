/**
 * Exercise:
 *
 *   Write a program that reads from the console a series of
 *   integers and prints the smallest and largest of them.
 *
 * Solution & Guidelines:
 *
 *   First, declare and define the following variables:
 *     int n, sequence[100],
 *         currNum, minNum = INT_MAX, maxNum = INT_MIN;
 *
 *   And then:
 *     1. Read the count of numbers user wants to enter (int n).
 *     2. Consequently read the numbers and keep them in
 *        an one dimensional array (int sequence[100]).
 *     3. Iterate over the array and do the following operations:
 *        - if current number < min number then min number = current number
 *        - if current number > max number then max number = current number
 *     4. Print min and max numbers.
 *
 *   Please make sure the code is clean and readable.
